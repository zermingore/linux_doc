Random Linux help website code (only in french, so far).

Some features:
- Aimed at new Linux users, without in-depth knowledge of any Operating System, trying to use and understand a Linux based System
- Trying to cover far too many topics (for instance System, Tooling, Shell, programmation in multiple languages)
- Trying to cover the range newcommer <-> expert is simply crazy


Online version so far:
code.nulmail.com/


Pull or Feature Requests, for anything (new topic, typo, new language support, in-depth knowledge) greatly appreciated.
