    <h1>Warning</h1>
    This site is still a draft under construction.<br/>
    Its goal is still not clear defined (cheat-sheets; beginner guide; diving into some rabbit holes; ...).<br/>
    The required skills (for the basics) are *really* low.<br/>

    <h1>Content</h1>
    <ol>
      The guide is divided in multiple sections.<br/>
      Survival: How to survive under linux. Start here if you're not sure.<br/>
      Linux Basics: Linux command line understanding.<br/>
      Linux Programmation: Programmation under Linux.<br/>
      Advanced: Deep understanding in some themes.<br/>
      Hard-Core: Diving some rabbit holes, <em>really</em> understand how things work. These are <em>really</em> difficult topics and it's totally ok if you don't grasp everything.
    </ol>
